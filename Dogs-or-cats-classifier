I created a project on Google Colab using Python libraries like Keras and TensorFlow to build a powerful Dogs and Cats classifier. Leveraging deep learning techniques, I trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a vast dataset of labeled dog and cat images. With extensive data preprocessing, I achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between these two popular pet categories.

The model exhibits robustness in recognizing various breeds and fur patterns, making it a valuable tool for pet enthusiasts and animal shelters. Additionally, I employed data augmentation and fine-tuning to enhance its performance, ensuring it can handle diverse real-world scenarios. This project showcases the potential of deep learning in image classification tasks and serves as a foundation for future AI-powered pet-related applications.
